<!-- This has a 'news' root element, and can have any number of 'newsitem' elements. 'newsitem' has a 'department' attribute that I use to generate a 'from the XYZ department' like you would find in MAD Magazine. The 'headline' element has a 'date' attribute (which is a string, so it can be anything), and a 'postlink' attribute that I use to generate an anchor for linking to a specific post. The contents of the 'headline' element show the title of the entry when the page is rendered. 

The 'newsparagraph' element contains the HTML-formatted text of the entry.

<news>

 <newsitem department="Example">
	 <headline date="date goes here" postlink="anchortext">Headline goes here</headline>
    <newsparagraph>

<p>HTML-formatted entry goes here.</p>

    </newsparagraph>
</newsitem>

</news>
