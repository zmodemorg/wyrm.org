    <newsparagraph>I tried everything I could think of to find that file you asked me for. I scoured every directory I knew about, including the secret ones (which was hard since there are no secret directories), and I just couldn't find it. I hate to ask, but could you maybe check the URL and try again? </newsparagraph>
