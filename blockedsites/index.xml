<!-- The root element, 'index', contains any number of 'site' elements. The 'site' element has the 'category' attribute, which is mapped to the above list, and 'added', which is the date I added it to the list. Though the 'added' is just a string, so it can be anything. 'site' also had the sub elements 'name', which is the name of the site, 'url', which is just text that doesn't link anywhere, and 'reason', which is the reason that I blocked them -->

<index>

  <site category="" added="">
    <name></name>
    <url></url>
    <reason></reason>
  </site>

</index>
